<p>
Today, I was thinking about investing. I was thinking that if I put  \(X_0\) amount of money in investing for some \( T\) years with a return of \(r\). What should I do with the interest that I receive? Should I consume this or re-invest this into my account again? The logical assumption could be that  I would like to maximize my consumption from this investment. So imagine the following question:
</p>

<p>
Imagine you are an investor and you are investing \(X_0\) amount of money at \(t=0\). This invested money is there and the investor cannot withdraw the money; Now, this invested money pays \(r\% \) interest for total of \( T\) years. Each year, you as the investor can consume \( a(t)\) portion of this interest and re-invests the rest \( 1-a(t)\). What portion of this interest-payment money should you consume each year, so that the total amount of consumption is maximized?

<p>
Let's solve this. First I assume that the time is continuous (that's how I roll!). So, Mathematically speaking, our money follows the following ODE
</p>

<p>
\[
\frac{dX}{dt} = r X(t) (1-a(t)) 
\] 
where \( r\) is the continuous interest rate. At the same time, the amount of money consumed is the following 
</p>

<p>
\[
C = \int_0^T r X(t) a(t) dt 
\]
So our question, in mathematical terms is to find the best consumption plan \(a^*(t)\) such that our consumption is maximized, in other words 
\[
a^*(t) = \text{arg} \max_{a(t)} \int_0^T r X(t) a(t) dt \label{eq:1}\\ 
\text{such that  } \frac{dX}{dt} = r X(t) (1-a(t)) 
\] 
Note that \( 0 \leq a(t) \leq 1 \). The dynamics equation (second equation) has an easy answer 
\[ 
X(t) = X_0 \exp\left( {rt - r\int_0^t a(t) dt}\right)
\] 
Now inserting this result into the first equation, we find the consumption as 
\[
a^*(t) = \text{arg} \max_{a(t)} r\int_0^T r X(t) a(t) dt  = \text{arg} \max_{a(t)} \int_0^T r ~ X_0 ~ a(t)  \exp\left( {rt - r\int_0^t a(t) dt}\right)  dt  
\] 
and our goal is to find a function \( a(t) \) that maximizes the above integral, which is our consumption. This ridiculously looks like Euler-Lagrange equation. Let's define \( b'(t) \equiv a(t) \) or equivalently \( b(t) = \int_0^t a(t') dt'\). Then our optimization problem becomes
\[
b^*(t)   = \text{arg} \max_{b(t)} \int_0^T r ~ X_0 ~b'(t)  \exp\left( {rt - rb(t)} \right)  dt  
\]
Now it's actually the same as Euler-Lagrange equation, where the Lagrangian is \( L(t,b(t),b'(t)) = r ~ X_0  ~b'(t)  \exp\left( {rt - rb(t)}\right) \). So we use the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation 
\[ 
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b(t) } = \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial b'(t)} \\
-r b'(t) = r-rb'(t) 
\]
Alright, so it seems that there is no solution here. This actually means that the extremums happen at the boundaries. Since \( 0 \leq a(t) \leq 1\), then it means that it happens when \( a = 0, \text{ or } 1 \). Physically speaking, it means that when we are either completely re-investing or completely consuming the interest payments. Alright, saving all the time is not the maximum, because it results in no consumption or \( C=0\). Spending all the interest we earn or \( a(t) = 1\) can be a solution. This basically means that our money is not growing in the fund, and it remains constant at \( X_0\), and we are always consuming the interest payments. This can also be seen in the equations, since   
\[
C = \int_0^T r ~ X_0    dt = r X_0 T
\]
Now we need to be careful. There are other boundary solutions that we can construct as well. Imagine the following plan: assume we  re-invest the interests we earn for \( 0 \leq t \leq T_c\) and then start spending all the interest at \( t\geq T_c\). This plan is again some boundary solution and could be an extremum. We need to calculate the consumption. So the plan is the following
\[ 
a(t) = \begin{cases}
0 & 0 \leq t \leq T_c\\
1 & T_c \leq t \leq T
\end{cases} 
\] 
Let's see how much consumption we can get from this plan. 
\[
C = \int_{T_c}^T r ~ X_0 ~  \exp\left( rt - r(t-T_c) \right)  dt   = \int_{T_c}^T r ~ X_0 ~  \exp\left( r T_c \right)  dt   = r X_0 (T-T_c) \exp \left( r T_c \right)
\]
In order to find the maximum of the above consumption, we take the derivative with respect to \( T_c\) to find 
\[
-1 + (T-T_c) r = 0 \quad \to \quad  T_c = T - \frac{1}{r} 
\]
Not that in order for \( T_c \geq 0\), then \( rT \geq 1\). For such \( T_c\), we find 
\[
C = X_0 \exp\left( rT - 1\right) 
\]
Let's plot the different solutions consumption

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Overall consumption divided by the initial investment \( C/X_0\)  versus interest rate times the total time of investment \(rT\). The blue curve is for re-investing the interests upto \(t=T_c\) and then consuming the interests afterward; the black curve corresponds to consume the interests from the beginning.</p>

<p>
So basically, upto \( rT=1\), it makes sense to consume all the interest payments, and for \( rT\geq1\) it's better to wait until \( T_c = T-\frac{1}{r}\) and then consume all the interest payments. To give it a more physical sense, assume you have a fund with \( 10\%\) APR, this means that \( \exp(r)-1 = 0.1 \) or \( r=  \log(1.1) \approx 0.04\). Now, if your goal is to invest for less than 25 years \( (25\times 0.04 =1 )\), you better use all the interest payments you're paid to maximize your consumption. If you are investing for more than 25 years, its better to re-invest all the interests for the first 25 years, and after that consume all the interest payments.
