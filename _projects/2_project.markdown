## Geometric Nonlinearity and Transition Waves

A carefully designed 1D
linkage mechanism can become bistable due to its geometric
nonlinearity. A chain of bistable elements support
transition waves propagation that sequentially switch
bistable elements from one stable configuration to
another. Transition waves have received significant interest
in recent years not only because of their rich physics, but
also for their potential applications, including
unidirectional propagation, energy harvesting and mechanical
computation. In my postdoctorate, we exploited the
propagation of transition waves in a bistable 1D linkage as
a robust mechanism to realize structures that can be quickly
deployed. With a combination of experiments and analyses, we
showed that if the bistable joints are properly designed,
transition waves can propagate throughout the entire
structure and transform the initial straight configuration
into a curved one. We then demonstrated that such bistable
linkages can be used as building blocks to realize
deployable 3D structures of arbitrary shape.

## Non-reciprocal Digitized Gate

Motion at low Reynolds number is impossible with periodic wave motions due to time symmetry of equations; however, an asymmetric motion can generate locomotion. We have created an artificial mechanisms that mimic the locomotory functions of nematodes with efficient viscous pumping. We show that the blade not only induces a flow structure similar to that of the worm, but also mixes the surrounding fluid by generating a circulatory flow.
