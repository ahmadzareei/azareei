<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
A simple model of nonlinear salt-finger convection in two dimensions is derived and studied. The model is valid in the limit of small solute to heat diffusivity ratio and large density ratio, which is relevant to both oceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the magnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers, appropriate for astrophysical applications, a modified Rayleigh-Benard system with large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For large Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines a prognostic equation for the solute field and a diagnostic equation for inertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identified for the second model: The weakly driven regime is characterized by a large-scale flow associated with a balance between advection and linear instability, while the strongly driven regime produces multiscale structures, resulting in a balance between the energy input through linear instability and the energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict and numerically confirm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity fluxes on the ratio between solute and heat Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and probability density functions are also computed.  </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Understanding and controlling the drainage kinetics of thin liquid films is an important problem that underlies the stability, lifetime and rheology of foams and emulsions. Ultrathin films formed with micellar solutions exhibit stratification due to confinement-induced structuring and layering of surfactant micelles. Stratification is manifested as stepwise thinning over time, and it greatly modifies the stability and lifetime of the micellar foam film. Stratification proceeds by the formation and expansion of thinner domains at the expense of surrounding thicker film, and results in formation of nanoscopic terraces and mesas within a film. Using Interferometry Digital Imaging Optical Microscopy (IDIOM) protocols developed in-house, we visualize and analyze the structure formation and thickness variations associated with stratification in films made with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In particular, the shape and the growth dynamics of nanoridges that flank expanding thinner domains are characterized experimentally for the first time. We show that the formation, evolution and instability of the nanoridges can be described quantitatively by nonlinear thin film equation, amended with supramolecular oscillatory surface forces. </p>
