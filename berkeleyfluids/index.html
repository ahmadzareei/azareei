  <p style="text-indent: 25px" align="justify">The Berkeley Fluids Seminar series meets weekly on Mondays to discuss about the broad spectrum of cutting-edge fluid dynamics research. It is a great opportunity for the Fluids community in Berkeley (students, postdocs and faculty members) and for visitors to gather and share research thoughts in an informal context. It starts over on January 30. The seminars will be hold on Mondays in 3110 Etcheverry Hall with a few exceptions. The schedule for the Spring Semester 2017 is available <a href="spring17.html" title="Spring 2017schedule">here</a>.</p><br>
  <p style="text-indent: 25px" align="justify"><b>If you are willing to participate, we would be glad to have you give a seminar and meet the Berkeley Fluids community. Please feel free to contact us (contact on the left panel).</b></p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
A simple model of nonlinear salt-finger convection in two dimensions is derived and studied. The model is valid in the limit of small solute to heat diffusivity ratio and large density ratio, which is relevant to both oceanographic and astrophysical applications. Two limits distinguished by the magnitude of the Schmidt number are found. For order one Schmidt numbers, appropriate for astrophysical applications, a modified Rayleigh-Benard system with large-scale damping due to a stabilizing temperature is obtained. For large Schmidt numbers, appropriate for the oceanic setting, the model combines a prognostic equation for the solute field and a diagnostic equation for inertia-free momentum dynamics. Two distinct saturation regimes are identified for the second model: The weakly driven regime is characterized by a large-scale flow associated with a balance between advection and linear instability, while the strongly driven regime produces multiscale structures, resulting in a balance between the energy input through linear instability and the energy transfer between scales. For both regimes, we analytically predict and numerically confirm the dependence of the kinetic energy and salinity fluxes on the ratio between solute and heat Rayleigh numbers. The spectra and probability density functions are also computed.  </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Understanding and controlling the drainage kinetics of thin liquid films is an important problem that underlies the stability, lifetime and rheology of foams and emulsions. Ultrathin films formed with micellar solutions exhibit stratification due to confinement-induced structuring and layering of surfactant micelles. Stratification is manifested as stepwise thinning over time, and it greatly modifies the stability and lifetime of the micellar foam film. Stratification proceeds by the formation and expansion of thinner domains at the expense of surrounding thicker film, and results in formation of nanoscopic terraces and mesas within a film. Using Interferometry Digital Imaging Optical Microscopy (IDIOM) protocols developed in-house, we visualize and analyze the structure formation and thickness variations associated with stratification in films made with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In particular, the shape and the growth dynamics of nanoridges that flank expanding thinner domains are characterized experimentally for the first time. We show that the formation, evolution and instability of the nanoridges can be described quantitatively by nonlinear thin film equation, amended with supramolecular oscillatory surface forces. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> Despite continuous improvement in medical technologies and imaging, cardiovascular disease forms the leading cause of mortality and death, necessitating development of alternative technologies. Computational modeling provides a low cost, non-invasive modality to complement animal testing and routine clinical care. Simulation-based diagnosis has demonstrated a growing impact in the clinic, ultimately leading to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. While this translation has been successfully achieved in vascular flow applications, cardiac hemodynamics (representing blood flow in heart chambers) has remained distant to clinical translation, partly due to the significant cost and complexity involved in modeling the underlying dynamics. These include high Reynolds number flows, moving chambers and fluid-structure interaction effects, in addition to the complex multiphysics interactions. In this talk, I will review some of the previous efforts, together with my own research on computational modeling of intracardiac flows. In particular, I will focus on the methods required to handle the above complexities, and how these methods were used to develop fundamental insights into the blood transport mechanisms in the heart, from using both simplified canonical heart models to complex image-based patient-specific models. I will then present the most recent advances made on modeling cardiac hemodynamics that are promising for clinical translation, and conclude by providing future directions in this area of research. </p>

<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> 
Suspensions of micron-size particles in Newtonian fluids are present in a broad spectrum of biological and engineering applications and understanding their rheological properties is a crucial task. Computational studies of such systems are challenging, but important simplifications occur when the Reynolds number is sufficiently small. In this context, the flow equations become linear and Stokesian dynamics simulations offer a feasible pathway for numerical investigations. We will show how it is possible to apply a box-deformation scheme developed by Andersen, Parrinello, and Rahman in the context of molecular dynamics simulations to the Stokesian dynamics of hard spheres suspended in a Newtonian fluid with fixed background flows. Combining that scheme with the box-reinitialization strategy of Kraynik and Reinelt, a perpetual extensional flow can be simulated. We find that in extensional flows simulations, quantities of rheological interest, such as the effective viscosity of the suspension, are robust against computationally-induced ordering. Such ordering, a well-known spurious effect encountered in shear-flow simulations, is easily suppressed in an extensional background flow simply due to the steric interaction of the hard spheres. </p>
