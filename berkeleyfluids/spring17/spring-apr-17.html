<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> A micro-continuum approach is
proposed to simulate the dissolution of solid minerals at the
pore-scale under single-phase-flow conditions.  The approach employ a
the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes formulation and locally averaged
conservation laws combined with immersed boundary conditions for the
chemical reaction at the solid surface. The methodology compares well
with the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian technique. The simulation
framework is validated using an experimental microfluidic device to
image the dissolution of a single calcite crystal. The evolution of
the calcite crystal during the acidizing process is analyzed and
related to flow conditions, i.e., Péclet and Damköhler
numbers. Macroscopic laws for the dissolution rate are proposed by
upscaling the pore-scale simulations. Finally, the emergence of
wormholes during the injection of acid in a two-dimensional domain of
calcite grains is discussed based on pore-scale simulations. </p>
