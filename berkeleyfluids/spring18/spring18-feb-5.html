<p align="justify"> <b> Abstract: </b> The flow contained in a
rotating circular split-cylinder with different associated boundary
conditions leads to a variety of instabilities and complex
dynamics. The study of a wide range of Direct Numerical Simulations of
the three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations elucidated the flow
behavior.

In the first configuration presented in detail, there exists a strong
background rotation with oscillatory boundary conditions. By imposing
a desired range of frequencies, inertial wave beams emanate from the
corner and the split of the cylinder, leading to
destructive/constructive interactions. The resulting flow produces
peaks in vorticity for some specific frequencies which are related to
the resonant Kelvin modes. The critical role of the symmetries of the
boundary conditions with the different Kelvin modes excited was
studied using the phase difference parameter, which easily allows
imposing different symmetries.

In the second configuration, both cylinder halves are in exact
counter-rotation, producing an O(2) symmetry in the system. In the
Basic State, the dynamic of the flow is dominated by the shear layer
created in the midplane. By changing the speed rotation and the aspect
ratio of the cylinder, the flow loses symmetries in a variety of ways
creating static waves, rotating waves, direction reversing waves and
slow-fast pulsing waves. The bifurcations were characterized and the
flow dynamics were clarified. Additionally, preliminary experimental
results for this case were performed. </p>
