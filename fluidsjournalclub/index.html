      <p style="text-indent: 25px" align="justify">The Fluids Journal Club series meets every other week on Friday to critically evaluate the broad spectrum of cutting-edge fluid dynamics research. It is a great opportunity for the Fluids community at UBC (students, postdocs and faculty members) and for visitors to gather and become more familiar with the advanced literature in fluids. In addition, these journal clubs help improve one's skills of understanding and debating current topics of active interest in fluids. Here you can share research thoughts in an informal context.</p>  <br>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 25px" align="justify">If you are willing to participate, we would be glad to have you give in the Journal Club and meet the Berkeley Fluids community. Please feel free to contact us (contact on the left panel).</p><br>
