<h2> About me: </h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Mechanical Engineering department at UC Berkeley. My research interests lie in  Theoretical and Applied Fluid Dynamics, Dynamical Systems, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics. 
<br /> <br />
I am being advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/m-reza-alam">M. Reza Alam</a> and a part of <a href="http://taflab.berkeley.edu/">TAF-Lab</a> group at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>. 
<br /> <br />
I graduated from <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/web/en/">Sharif University of Technology</a> undergraduate program in 2013. During my undergrad studies, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mirabbasjalali/">Mir A. Jalali</a> on Simulation of Perturbed Stellar Systems Using CUDA programming. I also worked with Prof. <a href="http://sharif.edu/~ejtehadi/">M. Reza Ejtehadi</a> on Aggregation Properties of Stiff Polyelectrolytes in Presence of Multivalent Salt. 
<br /> <br />
My research is funded in part by <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>. I am the PI for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/berkeleyfluids/index.html">Berkeley Fluids Seminar</a> since 2015.
