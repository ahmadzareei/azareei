<h2> About me: </h2>



I am currently postdoctoral fellow in Applied Mathematics in <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/">School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> working jointly with Professors <a href="https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/">Katia Bertoldi</a> and <a href="https://amir.seas.harvard.edu/">Ariel Amir</a>


<br />
<br />


I got my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>.  I was advised by Professor <a href="https://www.me.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/m-reza-alam">M. Reza Alam</a> in <a href="http://taflab.berkeley.edu/">Theoretical and Applied Fluids</a> group at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> where my work was mainly focused on nonlinear wave dynamics. My research was funded in part by <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> and I was PI for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/berkeleyfluids/index.html">Berkeley Fluids Seminar</a> from 2015 - 2018. I got my M.A. in <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Applied Mathematics</a> at UC Berkeley under supervision of Prof. <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~wilken/">Jon Wilkening</a>, where I worked on Quantum Hydrodynamic Analogs: Euler-Schr&ouml;dinger Transformation.  Prior to my graduate studies, I got my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and in Physics from <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/web/en/">Sharif University of Technology</a> in 2013. During my undergrad studies, I worked with Prof. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mirabbasjalali/">Mir A. Jalali</a> on Simulation of Perturbed Stellar Systems Using CUDA programming. You can find my mathematical genealogy in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/Ahmad-genealogy.png">here</a>.

I also worked with
Prof. <a href="http://sharif.edu/~ejtehadi/">M. Reza Ejtehadi</a> on
Aggregation Properties of Stiff Polyelectrolytes in Presence of
Multivalent Salt.
