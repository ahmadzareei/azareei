<h2> Machine Learning: </h2>

Calculus is a toolkit for doing physics, and for doing many other
things besides, ranging from engineering to actuarial work. Invention
of 'Calculus' changed our understanding of the world.

I believe Neural Networks & Machine Learning is the new calculus and
is shaping a new future. Similar to Calculus, it is a toolkit that has
applications in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, mathematics,
all branches of engineering, and more. In these posts, I will share my
journey in learning machine learning/neural networks and applying it
to questions in my mind.
