      shallow water</font></a></strong><br> A major obstacle in designing a
      perfect cloak for objects in shallow-water waves is that the
      linear transformation media scheme (also known as transformation
      optics) requires spatial variations of two independent medium
      properties. In the Maxwell’s equation and for the well-studied
      problem of electromagnetic cloaking, these two properties are
      permittivity and permeability. Designing an anisotropic material
      with both variable permittivity and variable permeability, while
      challenging, is achievable. On the other hand, for long gravity
      waves, whose governing equation maps one-to-one to the single
      polarization Maxwell’s equations, the two required spatially
      variable properties are the water depth and the gravitational
      acceleration; in this case changing the gravitational
      acceleration is simply impossible. Here we present a nonlinear
      transformation that only requires the change in one of the
      medium properties, which, in the case of shallow-water waves, is
      the water depth, while keeping the gravitational acceleration
      constant. This transformation keeps the governing equation
      perfectly intact and, if the cloak is large enough,
      asymptotically satisfies the necessary boundary conditions.

      Flexural Waves</font></a></strong><br> The governing equation
      for elastic waves in flexural plates is not form invariant, and
      hence designing a cloak for such waves faces a major
      challenge. Here, we present the design of a perfect broadband
      cloak for flexural waves through the use of a nonlinear
      transformation in the region of the cloak and by matching term
      by term the original and transformed equations and also assuming
      a prestressed material with body forces. For a readily
      achievable flexural cloak in a physical setting, we further
      present an approximate adoption of our perfect cloak under more
      restrictive physical constraints. Through direct simulation of
      the governing equations, we show that this cloak, as well,
      maintains a consistently high cloaking efficiency over a broad
      range of frequencies. The methodology developed here may be used
      for steering waves and designing cloaks in other physical
      systems with non-form-invariant governing equations.

    GRIN Lens </font></a></strong><br> A significant challenge in
    flexural wave energy harvesting is the design of an
    aberration-free lens capable of finely focusing waves over a broad
    frequency range. To date, flexural lenses have been created using
    discrete inclusions, voids, or stubs, often in a periodic
    arrangement, to focus waves via scattering. These structures are
    narrowband either because scattering is efficient over a small
    frequency range, or the arrangements exploit Bragg scattering
    bandgaps, which themselves are narrowband. In addition, current
    lens designs are based on a single frequency and approximate the
    necessary refractive index profile discretely, introducing
    aberrations and frequency-dependent focal points. Here, we design
    a flexural GRIN lens in a thin plate by smoothly varying the
    plate’s rigidity, and thus its refractive index. Our lens (i) is
    broadband, since the design does not depend on frequency and does
    not require bandgaps, (ii) has a fixed focal point over a wide
    range of frequencies, and (iii) is theoretically capable of
    zero-aberration focusing. We numerically explore our Continuous
    Profile GRIN lens (CP-GRIN lens) and then experimentally validate
    an implemented design. Furthermore, we use a piezoelectric energy
    harvester disk, located at the first focus of the CP-GRIN, to
      document improvements in power gain. [<a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.5008576">PDF</a>]

      water around the object. The carpet will effectively bend the wave
      rays around the object and shield the object from impinging waves. The
      method can potentially open up a new avenue in the protection of ocean

    the solid bottom boundary is a main source for generation of
    internal waves. This interaction can lead to generation of
    near-inertial internal waves which appear as a prominent peak in
    the internal wave spectrum. In some specific occasions, if the
    bottom topography wavenumber is an integer coefficient of the
    wavenumber of incident internal wave, the interaction could lead
    to generation of high wavenumer internal waves which are
    potentially susceptible to breaking. Here we show that the
    distribution of energy of internal gravity waves over a patch of
    seabed corrugations strongly depends on the distance of the patch
    to adjacent seafloor features located downstream of the

    Unstable Internal Waves due to Resonant Harmonic
    Generation</font></a></strong><br> Here we show that there exist
    internal gravity waves that are inherently unstable, that is, they
    cannot exist in nature for a long time. The instability mechanism
    is a one-way (irreversible) harmonic-generation resonance that
    permanently transfers the energy of an internal wave to its higher
    harmonics. We show that, in fact, there are a countably infinite
    number of such unstable waves. For the harmonic-generation
    resonance to take place, nonlinear terms in the free surface
    boundary condition play a pivotal role, and the instability does
    not occur in a linearly-stratified fluid if a simplified boundary
    condition such as a rigid lid or a linearized boundary condition
    is employed. Harmonic-generation resonance presented here also
    provides a mechanism for the transfer of internal wave energy to
    the higher-frequency part of the spectrum where internal waves are
    more prone to breaking, hence losing energy to turbulence and heat
    and contributing to oceanic mixing..
