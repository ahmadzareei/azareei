      shallow water</font></a></strong><br> A major obstacle in designing a
      perfect cloak for objects in shallow-water waves is that the
      linear transformation media scheme (also known as transformation
      optics) requires spatial variations of two independent medium
      properties. In the Maxwell’s equation and for the well-studied
      problem of electromagnetic cloaking, these two properties are
      permittivity and permeability. Designing an anisotropic material
      with both variable permittivity and variable permeability, while
      challenging, is achievable. On the other hand, for long gravity
      waves, whose governing equation maps one-to-one to the single
      polarization Maxwell’s equations, the two required spatially
      variable properties are the water depth and the gravitational
      acceleration; in this case changing the gravitational
      acceleration is simply impossible. Here we present a nonlinear
      transformation that only requires the change in one of the
      medium properties, which, in the case of shallow-water waves, is
      the water depth, while keeping the gravitational acceleration
      constant. This transformation keeps the governing equation
      perfectly intact and, if the cloak is large enough,
      asymptotically satisfies the necessary boundary conditions.

    <td><strong><a href=""><font size="5">A significant challenge in
    flexural wave energy harvesting is the design of an
    aberration-free lens capable of finely focusing waves over a broad
    frequency range. To date, flexural lenses have been created using
    discrete inclusions, voids, or stubs, often in a periodic
    arrangement, to focus waves via scattering. These structures are
    narrowband either because scattering is efficient over a small
    frequency range, or the arrangements exploit Bragg scattering
    bandgaps, which themselves are narrowband. In addition, current
    lens designs are based on a single frequency and approximate the
    necessary refractive index profile discretely, introducing
    aberrations and frequency-dependent focal points. Here, we design
    a flexural GRIN lens in a thin plate by smoothly varying the
    plate’s rigidity, and thus its refractive index. Our lens (i) is
    broadband, since the design does not depend on frequency and does
    not require bandgaps, (ii) has a fixed focal point over a wide
    range of frequencies, and (iii) is theoretically capable of
    zero-aberration focusing. We numerically explore our Continuous
    Profile GRIN lens (CP-GRIN lens) and then experimentally validate
    an implemented design. Furthermore, we use a piezoelectric energy
    harvester disk, located at the first focus of the CP-GRIN, to
            document improvements in power gain.

      Flexural Waves</font></a></strong><br> The governing equation
      for elastic waves in flexural plates is not form invariant, and
      hence designing a cloak for such waves faces a major
      challenge. Here, we present the design of a perfect broadband
      cloak for flexural waves through the use of a nonlinear
      transformation in the region of the cloak and by matching term
      by term the original and transformed equations and also assuming
      a prestressed material with body forces. For a readily
      achievable flexural cloak in a physical setting, we further
      present an approximate adoption of our perfect cloak under more
      restrictive physical constraints. Through direct simulation of
      the governing equations, we show that this cloak, as well,
      maintains a consistently high cloaking efficiency over a broad
      range of frequencies. The methodology developed here may be used
      for steering waves and designing cloaks in other physical
      systems with non-form-invariant governing equations.

Plate</font></a></strong><br> An alternative way of cloaking is to use
an engineered elastic buoyant carpet placed on water around the
object. The carpet will effectively bend the wave rays around the
object and shield the object from impinging waves. The method can
potentially open up a new avenue in the protection of ocean objects,
particularly offshore structures, from the action of oceanic waves
hence reducing load on such structures.

This interaction can lead to generation of near-inertial internal waves which appear as a prominent peak in the internal wave spectrum. In some specific occasions, if the bottom topography wavenumber is an integer coefficient of the wavenumber of incident internal wave, the interaction could lead to generation of high wavenumer internal waves which are potentially susceptible to breaking. Here we show that the distribution of energy of internal gravity waves over a patch of seabed corrugations strongly depends on the distance of the patch to adjacent seafloor features located downstream of the patch.[<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-fluid-mechanics/article/sensitivity-of-internal-wave-energy-distribution-over-seabed-corrugations-to-adjacent-seabed-features/0369A332EED59E8E7986B4473D336D61">PDF</a>]

Waves due to Resonant Harmonic Generation</font></a></strong><br> Here
we show that there exist internal gravity waves that are inherently
unstable, that is, they cannot exist in nature for a long time. The
instability mechanism is a one-way (irreversible) harmonic-generation
resonance that permanently transfers the energy of an internal wave to
its higher harmonics. We show that, in fact, there are a countably
infinite number of such unstable waves. For the harmonic-generation
resonance to take place, nonlinear terms in the free surface boundary
condition play a pivotal role, and the instability does not occur in a
linearly-stratified fluid if a simplified boundary condition such as a
rigid lid or a linearized boundary condition is
employed. Harmonic-generation resonance presented here also provides a
mechanism for the transfer of internal wave energy to the
higher-frequency part of the spectrum where internal waves are more
prone to breaking, hence losing energy to turbulence and heat and
contributing to oceanic mixing..
